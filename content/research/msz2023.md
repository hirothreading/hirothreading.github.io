#### Abstract

The presence of an occasionally binding constraint from the effective lower bound (ELB) in New Keynesian models often leads to multiple or no equilibria. The problem stems from a strong feedback loop between expectations (of inflation and output) and current outcomes at the ELB. We show that simple fiscal policy rules can introduce additional stabilising forces that dampen this loop, thereby ensuring the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium.
