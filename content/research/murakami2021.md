#### Abstract:

This paper builds and estimates a small open economy New Keynesian DSGE model, specified with an international banking sector, in order to explore the effectiveness of alternative monetary police regimes to isolate the domestic economy from global financial cycles. Using an increase to the Federal Funds Rate as a proxy for a sudden stop shock to a small open economy, I find that the Mundellian policy trilemma still persists. However, even a monetary authority adopting a floating exchange rate cannot fully buffer the effects of a global financial shock due to the tight integration of global financial markets.
