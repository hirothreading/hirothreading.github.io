## Notes on Macroeconomics

[Macroeconomics `*`*in progress*`*`](https://hirothreading.github.io/teaching/masters-phd/macroeconomics/macro_notes_2.pdf)

An updated version of my personal lectures notes for postgraduate macroeconomics. Some sections will be cut, some will be added, and I am trying to rewrite the notes to clean up typos and make the notation more consistent with textbooks and seminal papers. The original set of notes can be found below under the University of Oxford section.
